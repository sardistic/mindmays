# Architecture Decisions

## 2026-08-31 — Production container

- Package the browser game and its WebSocket/Wikipedia proxy as one Node.js container.
- Run as the unprivileged `node` user with a read-only filesystem and no published host ports.
- Expose `/health` for container and deployment verification.
- Keep production orchestration outside the source checkout while retaining a versioned Compose template under `deploy/`.

## 2026-09-01 — Classic trivia rotation

- Keep the authored trivia bank client-side so every question remains inspectable and can link directly to a Wikipedia research subject; generated families live in a separate data module to keep game logic readable.
- Maintain exactly 400 unique prompts, including a statically validated 336-question expansion balanced evenly across four levels.
- Persist a 96-question most-recently-used history in the browser.
- Prefer questions absent from that history; after a filtered subject/level pool is exhausted, recycle its least-recently asked prompt.

## 2026-09-01 — Character irritation memory

- Persist dialogue-choice counts by character and action so inhabitants remember repeated questions across encounters.
- Give the first repeated press and the next two escalation tiers character-specific responses; at the highest tier, intensify the close framing and dialogue chrome without changing controls or blocking play.
